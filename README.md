# francis-albert

A very simple functional ear trainer built to get familiar with [Overtone](). Inspired by the much more advanced [FET]().

TODO:

* Learn the ways of overtone
* Other instruments
* Cadence tempo
* More cadences
* Configurable note selection. Full-chromatic is a little tough for beginners.

## Usage

    $ lein deps
    $ lein run

You'll hear a three-chord cadence and then a note. Guess the interval of the note using the buttons provided. Then you'll hear another cadence and another note. Forever.
